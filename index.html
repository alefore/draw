<h1>Instructions</h1>

<p>This is a tool to draw by iteration, selecting from randomly generated
variations of a given image.</p>

<p>Click a link at the top (e.g. "add") to generate variations of the image;
these are shown in smaller canvas.
If you see a variation that you like, click
to make it the new image. New variations will then be displayed (according to
the last tool that you used (you can use "back" to undo your last
selection).
Some tools (e.g. "extend" or "tweak") affect the "active" segment: the
one shown in red. Use the "active" operation to change the active segment
(you'll need to choose one of the variations).
</p>

<p>Mouse over the tools to see more information about their behavior.</p>

<p>Reload the file to discard your current state and start again from scratch.
The textarea with code represents your current image. You can copy that into
a file to save the state. If you paste it back and click "Apply", you can
restore the state.</p>

<p>There's some sample images in the
<a href="http://github.com/alefore/draw">GitHub repository</a>
(directory samples/, feel free to send me more)</p>
