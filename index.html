<h1>Instructions</h1>

<p>This is a tool to draw by iteration, selecting from randomly generated
variations of a given image.</p>

<p>Click a link at the top (e.g. "add") to generate variations of the image;
these are shown in smaller canvas.
If you see a variation that you like, click
to make it the new image. New variations will then be displayed (according to
the last tool that you used (you can use "back" to undo your last
selection).
Some tools (e.g. "extend" or "tweak") affect the "active" segment: the
one shown in red. Use the "active" operation to change the active segment
(you'll need to choose one of the variations).
</p>

<p>Mouse over the tools to see more information about their behavior.</p>

<p><b>To discard the current state and start again from scratch:</b> reload the
file.</p>

<p><b>To save your current image:</b> if you just want the image, just right
click and use "Save As". To preserve also the state (allowing you to continue
tweaking it later), just copy the code from the textarea. You can paste it back
into the textarea in the future and click "Apply" to restore the state.</p>

<p>There's some sample images in the
<a href="http://github.com/alefore/draw">GitHub repository</a>
(directory samples/, feel free to send me more)</p>
